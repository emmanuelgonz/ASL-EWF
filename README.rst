ASL-EWF
=======
ASL-EWF provides a command line interface (CLI) for the AirSurf-Lettuce application created by the `Crops Phenomics Group
<https://github.com/Crop-Phenomics-Group/>`_. This CLI allows you to quickly feed inputs through the command line, rather than using a GUI. 

Using ASL-EWF
-------------
To use the CLI, download the repo and run the whole_pipe function found in the aslfire2.py file as follows:

.. code::

   python3 aslfire2.py whole_pipe <'output_dir'> <'image_filename'> <'trainedmodel_dir'>
